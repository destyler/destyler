# 更新所有包的 package.json 元数据 (2025-11-28 06:22Z)

_**User (2025-11-28 06:26Z)**_

我想给我每一个 packages 下的依赖的 package.json 都增加

```
"private": "false",
"homepage": "https://github.com/destyler/destyler",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/destyler/destyler.git",
    "directory": "packages/components/aspect-ratio"
  },
    "publishConfig": {
      "access": "public"
    },
```

这些东西,同时 repository.directory 是他们的目录,但是因为太多了,所以我希望你可以直接帮我

**Planning package.json updates**

I’m outlining a multi-step plan to add or correct the "private" string field and other keys in every package.json under packages/. Since this involves many files, I’ll start by inventorying which packages need updates, probably using a script or command-line tools, then systematically update them and verify the changes. Managing this as a todo list will keep the process clear.**Starting first task and identifying packages****Searching for package.json files****Planning package.json metadata update script**

I’m thinking through writing a Node script to recursively update all package.json files under packages/ to add or fix fields like private, homepage, repository, and publishConfig while preserving formatting and key order as much as possible. I want to compute relative paths for repository.directory and keep existing fields where applicable. Next, I’ll prepare the script and run it in the terminal to automate the updates safely.**Advancing to next task****Drafting Node.js script for package updates****Adding isBackground flag****Verifying aspect ratio updates****Verifying field insertion in components****Reviewing dependency order and next steps****Summarizing package.json updates**

I'll explain that a Node script added consistent metadata to 72 package.json files in various package folders like components, frameworks, shareds, and others. I’ll highlight that repository.directory fields now correctly point to subfolders. Then, I’ll suggest next steps like running `git status`, verifying private packages, and optionally running linting or tests. I want this final message to be clear and helpful with a simple bullet list of key points.Added the requested metadata (`private: "false"`, shared GitHub homepage, scoped `repository.directory`, and `publishConfig.access`) to every manifest under `packages/*`, covering 72 packages across components, frameworks, shared utilities, and core libs (e.g. `package.json`, `package.json`, `package.json`). Each file now points its `repository.directory` to its actual subfolder so publishing picks up the right path.

Next steps:
1. Review `git status` to verify only the intended `package.json` files changed.
2. Double-check any package that should remain private before publishing.
