帮我给所有的 tsdown 加上 hash: false 这个选项

**Searching for tsdown config files****Checking for missing hash:false entries****Preparing batch update for tsdown.config.ts files****Troubleshooting newline escaping in shell script****Analyzing incomplete heredoc execution**

I'm trying to figure out why the node script using heredoc isn't finishing—looks like the terminal is still waiting for the closing `NODE` delimiter. The output shows partial lines suggesting the input wasn't completed, possibly due to truncation or quoting issues, so I’m considering strategies to send the missing `NODE` line or interrupt the process to finalize the command execution.**Analyzing shell prompt behavior****Troubleshooting node script execution**

I'm working through why the previous `node` command aborted before running and figuring out how to safely run a complex inline script. I’m exploring ways to run the script with proper escaping—considering heredoc with exact formatting, temp script files, or carefully escaped `node -e` commands—to ensure the Node process accepts and executes the entire script correctly.**Considering file search and insertion methods****Verifying hash flag updates****Verifying script coverage completeness****Gathering changed files****Summarizing tsdown config changes and other diffs**

I’m sorting through a large set of file changes where only the tsdown config files were intentionally updated by a script to add `hash: false` across about 74 files. Other files like docs data, pnpm-lock.yaml, and specstory also show changes, but those weren’t from the script and might be pre-existing or unrelated modifications. I want to clearly explain this in the summary, note that we didn’t revert any of those other diffs since they might be important, and suggest verifying with a build to ensure everything’s good. I’ll highlight the main impact, that the scripted updates touched many files, and remind about those additional pending diffs without accidentally implying we made those.**Tsdown Hash Flag**  
- Added `hash: false` to every `tsdown.config.ts` so all packages share the same bundle hashing behaviour (73 files updated; `tsdown.config.ts` already had it).  
- Confirmed no remaining config files are missing the flag.

You still have other workspace changes (`packages/docs/data/*.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `.specstory/history/...`) that were unrelated to this edit—let me know if they need attention.

Next step: if you rely on tsdown outputs, consider running your usual build/check (e.g. `pnpm -r build`) to confirm everything stays green.
